For my Birthday my fiancé bought me a domain and after a lot of umming and ahhh ing about hosting etc I have decided I’m going to host it myself.

“Why?” you might ask, well, for a few reasons:

* I don't wanna spend loads of money just yet (I’m still a student!)
* What I want my hosting for is likely to change very rapidly – I don’t wanna be tied down
* I wanna know how it all works – what are the steps in setting up a server?
* I can use it for other things – like hosting games ;)

My domain is stephcook.me if you want to follow my progress, in the long run I will be moving my blog over there onto a local version of wordpress
but its not quite ready yet :) In the meantime I’m gunna keep blogging about my finds and experiences.
