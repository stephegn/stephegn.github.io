Been bombarded with Adobe products this week, what with Flex and Illustrator and its all good, in fact I'm pleasantly surprised at flex. However their website is really not great.
Spent all day battling with it and I'm still not finished with what I'm doing.

Anyway, did my Illustrator training this week, really impressed with what I could put together with it, I have been drawing some ‘test’ images suitable to put on Verve Sketch the
program I will be starting work on next week. It really showed me how Verve Sketch can be useful and a real time saver for designers!

Finally got the source code for Verve Sketch and had a good look, it seems pretty simple and Paul is making some really good improvements on it before he leaves for University.
Skins seem to be the hardest thing to get my head around so I’m going to have to have a good look at those.

Finished off my Illustrator scripts (ish) this week, still have some final checking and sorting out errors and stuff but they work. Also need to look into good ways of distributing them.

Bring on next week!
