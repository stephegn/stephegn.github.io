Went to the (@android_mcr) Manchester Android Meetup last week, I have been before and it was really interesting.
Discussed databases and data storing methods and there were some interesting ideas. I am determined to start work on an android app of my own!

First stop would be installing the SDK but iâ€™ve yet to get round to that.

I will be attending the (@pluginlancs) Plug-in-Lancashire tea party in a couple of weeks too, I think the meetups are a great idea and really interesting.
