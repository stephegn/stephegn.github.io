I have finally started developing for android. I was motivated by my Dad wanting an app that just didn’t seem to be on the market.

I first tried installing the SDK on my Dad’s windows PC but failed miserably, it doesn't seem to recognise my JDK so refuses to install
so instead I have installed it on my laptop which runs linux and all has gone well. There is a step by step tutorial here.

I am going to use eclipse to develop on for several reasons:
There is a handy plugin for quick access to the SDK and code hinting.
Flash builder is based on eclipse so I’m already pretty used to how it works.
I also used eclipse at university (a bit) for my Java development.

I have started the Hello World tutorial just to check everything is working correctly, it ran fine but was very slow, I need to figure out why and how I can speed it up in the future.
