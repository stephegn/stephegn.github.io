I have just finished (and handed in) the code for my RSS Aggregator 3rd Year Project.

In order for me to really know how well my program achieves its goal I need some opinions. I have made a pretty simple (nothing fancy) interface to help you do this.

All you have to do is go to my projects evaluation page and click a few dropdowns and a few buttons.

The data will go towards my final report and hopefully any further work I do on this project! I donâ€™t collect anything personal, just what you select in those boxes.

Thank you!
