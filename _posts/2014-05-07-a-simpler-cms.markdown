I have been running my blog on Wordpress for about 2 or 3 years now. Wordpress is great. Install it and suddenly you have a website, with easy to use admin tools,
however I have always felt Wordpress was a bit overkill for the amount of posts I host on my blog and how simple it is. I just want an easy way to write content.
So me and [Qas Ashraf](http://twitter.com/QasAshraf) got together and came up with Chula.

Chula is aimed at people who know enough about the web to set up a website and don't need a full blown CMS. Posts are written in Markdown and functionality is
purposely limited to just the basic needs. We have both talked about writing our own themes for our wordpress blogs and although this isnt hard there is a bit
of learning to do first and it is just so easy to find something already made which is suitable. Chula ships with a basic example theme which is not meant to go
into production but is instead a base on which you can put your mark.

Chula is only at the very first stages at the moment. Please feel free to contribute [here](http://github.com/stephegn/chula) or try it out on your own blog.
