I have been working on my 3rd year project since September. Unfortunately this is the first time I have had the time to post an update about it and I am over half the way in!

The project is an RSS Aggregator, it collects articles from multiple RSS feeds into ‘stories’, these are then thinned down so they are easier to read.

Current project status is that the story collecting is being done. It’s doing this OK but not great. However, right now I am focusing on the ‘thinning down’.
To do this I am comparing sentences and deciding whether they add anything to the current article or not. I will evaluate a couple of different methods of doing this.
I am looking for volunteers to help me with this so if you are interested please get in touch (more on this another day).

I am hoping to get this live tonight so you can have a look at my progress if you are interested. I am also looking at publishing the code behind it all, but that will need a little more work.
