After a heap of problems with my database access my RSS Aggregator is now live! You can go, have a look and see what you think.

This is a natural language project and these systems are hard. I want to make sure the aggregator is the best it can be.
To do this I need some people to help me evaluate which algorithms are best. I am currently working on a nice easy way to collect
all this data so you can just go through as many stories as you have time for and simply check off sentences which shouldn’t be there.
If you are interested in getting involved please contact me and I will let you know when it’s all ready.
