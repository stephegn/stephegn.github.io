I have been extremely quiet over the past few months but this isn’t to say I haven’t been busy! Some major things have happened in my life and it’s only just about calming down.

So, first of all I graduated. I am now Stephanie Cook Bsc Computer Science WIE. That’s pretty cool! Graduation was an amazing day but I’m really going to miss all the great people I met at Uni.

Graduation

Secondly, I started working for Magma Digital (you can see my wonderful face here). I started at Magma Digital as an intern, working 1 day a week while I was at university (and didn’t have exams).
It was a great experience, I got to dabble in a real project, learn loads of new things and go on a staff do or two! I am loving working at Magma Digital a whole bunch, everyone is really nice
and have really made me feel part of the team, it’s also my kind of web development agency. We are dealing with real world complicated Computer Science problems in PHP, not just basic websites.
Everything I do is interesting in it’s own way and challenging me from all angles. The amount I have learnt in the short space of time I have been here is astonishing and it’s great to be surrounded
by people who love it just as much as me!

Since starting at Magma Digital I have been meaning to knock off some blogs about all the awesome new technology I have been getting my teeth into so look out for those very soon.
