Started work last week, have learnt so much already!
Began by working out some scripts in illustrator. I’m doing those in java script, which is really hard at times because I have yet to find good documentation and on top of that a lot of it is adobe specific so I have to filter out all the generic web stuff.

Towards the end of the week I started the Flex In A Week (FIAW) tutorial, it’s very different to anything I’ve worked with before although I’m seeing a lot of distributed terms popping up which makes me happy!

Flex is what Adobe Air runs and what the product I’m going to be working on is written in. There is also a PHP back end which should be OK with bits of XML thrown in for good measure. There was talk of using a PHP framework although this has not been finalised, will have to look for details on those.

Finally, just today I started looking into Adobe Illustrator plug-ins which are written in C++, if I start doing those it really will be a fun week!
