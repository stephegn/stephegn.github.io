After learning java for the whole of my first year at uni I am very confident with the OOP way of working. Recently I have been
translating those ideas across to PHP to make my code more readable and reusable.

However I have finally discovered one thing in PHP which does not work as I had expected. This being method overloading. Which is having more
than one method with the same name but different arguments. This just doesn’t happen in PHP. However, the solution I have been using is default
arguments this is where an argument can have a default value if it is not set on the method call. This feels like a work around to me but I’m sure
some people more used to PHP would say the way Java works is a work around. Thankfully I can fix my code so it now works :)
